Welcome to FritzContact!

You have to specify the location of your xml-file, which was exported by your Fritz!Box.
Therefore you can enter in the TextView above the absolute file path. 
If you have saved your file as "fritz.xml" on the root directory of your SD-card, you do not need to change the path.
After parsing the file, I will show you all available contacts that are contained in your xml-file (I am silently omitting the Fritz!Box-internal phone numbers).
You can then select the desired contacts to import. Pressing menu gives the ability to select/deselect all entries.
Contacts will be saved locally on your mobile phone.
